# portfoilo-project-frontend

# Getting Started

This project is bootstrapped with create react app.

## Project Idea:

Using the previous project from mod 2, I will recreate a new generator, where you can create, update, and delete agents. 


## User Stories:

- As a user, you will be greeted bt a welcome page. Welcome page will have a breif summary of project and a "continue" button. Clicking the continue button will send you to the home page.

- As a user, the home page will have a Agent card randomizing generator. (when agent is selected, agent's abilities will show).

- As a user, there will be a page to navigate to the Agents (card). when agent is clicked on, it will show the agents description. 

- As a user, you are able to create, update, and delete your own agent. 

- As a user, there will be a page to navigate to an About me page.
